# matrix-bootstrap-navbar
# This code uses the <marquee> element to create a simple scrolling effect, but it's important to note that it's considered non-standard 
# and is not recommended for modern web development. 
# This is because it's not part of the official HTML specification and may not work consistently across different browsers.
# It has a link to boostrap class but does not use bootstrap.
